# Inception

This project aims to broaden your knowledge of system administration by using Docker. You will virtualize several Docker images, creating them in your new personal virtual machine.

#### •A Docker container that contains NGINX with TLSv1.2 or TLSv1.3 only.
#### •A Docker container that contains WordPress + php-fpm (it must be installed and configured) only without nginx.
#### •A Docker container that contains MariaDB only without nginx.
#### •A volume that contains your WordPress database.
#### •A second volume that contains your WordPress website files.
#### •A docker-network that establishes the connection between your containers.
